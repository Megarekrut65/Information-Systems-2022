# Information-Systems-2022
## Project topic: "Smart Library" mini-library.
The application will be created to manage the information required for the library. The application will have a client-server structure for the possibility of expanding the system from one library to a network of libraries.
## Data:
Books, readers, issue, continuation, return, loss, purchase, cancellation of books, authors, authorship, publishing houses, roles, genres, tags (short description of the book in the form of one or two words).
## Functions:
Accounting for books, readers, demand, authors, publishers, informing about the need to purchase or write off books, informing about books that need to be returned, filtering data by parameters, creating reports, recommending similar books by keywords.
In this information system, the user will be able to track which books have been added, which books should be added (this means increasing the number of available books, if they are in demand), which books should be written off. It will also be possible to search for books by keywords and other parameters (title, genre, year of publication, publisher, author, etc.). The books that are soon to be returned by visitors will be displayed separately in the system.
## Technologies: Java, Spring, Hibernate, JavaScript.
The project will have a client-server structure. The server part of the application will be created using the Java programming language and the Spring framework. The client part will be implemented using the JavaScript language.
## DBMS: PostgreSQL.
The object-relational database management system PostgreSQL will be used for data storage. For convenient work with this database, the Hibernate tool for the Java platform will be used.
